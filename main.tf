You can create an Azure Storage Account using Terraform by defining the necessary resources in a `.tf` file. Below is an example configuration that creates a storage account named `myuniquestorageacct` in the specified resource group and region.

First, ensure that you have the Azure Provider set up in your Terraform configuration. You may also want to initialize your Terraform project and authenticate with Azure beforehand.

Hereâ€™s the complete Terraform configuration for your scenario:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "myresourcegroup"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "myuniquestorageacct" # Must be globally unique
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS" # Locally Redundant Storage

  # Optional arguments
  enable_https_traffic_only = true
  is_hns_enabled = false      # Hierarchical namespace; set to true for Data Lake Storage Gen2
}
```

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Ensure you have Terraform installed** on your machine.
2. Create a file with a `.tf` extension, for example, `main.tf`, and copy the above code into the file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory containing the Terraform configuration files.
5. Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration. Terraform will prompt you to confirm the action; type `yes`.

### Key points:

- The `name` of the storage account must be globally unique, which is why it's critical to ensure that `myuniquestorageacct` doesn't already exist in Azure or you might encounter an error.
- Adjust the replication type (`account_replication_type`) and service tiers (`account_tier`) as per your requirements.
- This example includes a couple of optional configurations like `enable_https_traffic_only`; you may customize more settings based on your needs.

Always monitor the deployment via the Azure portal or CLI to verify the creation of the resources.
